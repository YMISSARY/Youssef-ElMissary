
//1. Declare an array products that contains at least 10 products. Each product should be a string that represents the name of the product.

//2. Use a loop to display the list of products to the user. Each product should be displayed in a list item (<li>) element. The list should be displayed in an unordered list (<ul>) element.

//3. Create a function searchProducts that takes a string parameter query and returns an array of products that match the query. The function should search for products that contain the query in their name, and should be case-insensitive.

//4. Create an input field on the web page that allows the user to enter a search query. Use an event listener to call the searchProducts function whenever the user types in the input field.

//5. Use another loop to display the filtered list of products to the user. The filtered list should only include the products that match the search query.
